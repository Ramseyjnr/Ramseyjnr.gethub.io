              <li>it is hard to read what is written under the logo</li>
              <li>Files are managed well, with all files being in the project folder.</li>
              <li>No validation buttons included, but I do not think they are needed for this project as the website is being
                made for a client.</li>
              <li>On the Gallery page, most of the pictures are the same size.</li>
              <li>Styling and themes are consistent throughout the website.</li>

                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Constrast: </strong>Contrast is very good. Text and backgroud colors go well together and make
                    things easy to read.</li>
                  <li><strong>Repetition: </strong>Repetition is good. Themes and styes and easy to recognize between pages.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Alignment: </strong>Alignment is consistent between pages and is done in a way that looks good.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Proximity: </strong>Things on the pages are spaced consistently and a good distance from each
                    other that makes the pages seem full but not overly crowded. </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
      
              <li>All page are designed well and consistently, with good content on each.</li>
              <li>Keep up the good work!</li><br/>
