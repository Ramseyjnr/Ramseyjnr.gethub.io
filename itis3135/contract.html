                <li>I, Ramsey. Azure agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my SEMESTER 2022, ABC123, 
                    ITIS 3135  with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.
                </li>
                <li>I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and 
                    will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
                </li>
                <li>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, 
                    failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
                </li>
                <li>I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it’s possible to find many examples online or even view my classmates’ code directly. 
                    I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut and paste code except where i have properly given credit 
                    (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.
                </li>
