            <h3>M1A1 Abrams</h3>
            <p>
                The Abrams program is a mature, Acquisition Category IC program. Design decision authority is delegated to Program Executive Office 
                Ground Combat Systems, further empowering leaders at the lowest level to execute. This creates great Acquisition agility and enables quick reactions to the Army’s 
                requirements while focusing on the real-time needs of the warfighting formations.

                The Abrams Main Battle Tank closes with and destroys the enemy using mobility, firepower, and shock effect. 
                The Abrams is a full-tracked, low-profile, land combat assault weapon enabling expeditionary Warfighters to dominate
                 their adversaries through lethal firepower, unparalleled survivability, and audacious maneuver. The Abrams tank sends
                  a message to those who would oppose the United States as to the resolve, capability, and might of the U.S. Army. A 1,500-horsepower turbine 
                engine, 120 mm main gun and special armor make the Abrams tank particularly lethal against heavy armor forces.

            <h3>Stryker</h3>
            <p>
                The Stryker is a family of eight-wheeled armored fighting vehicles derived from the Canadian LAV III. 
                Stryker vehicles are produced by General Dynamics Land Systems-Canada (GDLS-C) for the United States Army in a plant in London, Ontario. 
                It has four-wheel drive (8×4) and can be switched to all-wheel drive (8×8).[8]

            </figure>
            <p>
                The Stryker was conceived as a family of vehicles forming the backbone of a new medium-weight brigade combat 
                team (BCT) that was to strike a balance between heavy armor and infantry. The service launched Interim Armored 
                Vehicle competition, and in 2000, the service selected the LAV III proposed by GDLS and General Motors Defense. The service named this family of vehicles the "Stryker".

            <h3>Bradleys</h3>
            <p>
                The M2 Bradley, or Bradley IFV, is an American infantry fighting vehicle that is a member of the Bradley Fighting Vehicle family.

            </figure>
            <p>
                The Bradley is designed for reconnaissance and to transport a squad of infantry, providing them protection from 
                small arms fire, while also providing firepower to both suppress and eliminate most threats to friendly infantry. 
                It is designed to be highly maneuverable and to be fast enough to keep up with heavy armor during an advance. 
                The M2 holds a crew of three: a commander, a gunner and a driver, as well as six fully equipped soldiers.

            <p>
                The High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV; colloquial: Humvee) is a family of light,
                 four-wheel drive, military trucks and utility vehicles produced by AM General.[10] It has largely 
                 supplanted the roles previously performed by the original jeep, and others such as the Vietnam War-era M151 jeep, the M561 "Gama Goat", 
                their M718A1 and M792 ambulance versions, the Commercial Utility Cargo Vehicle, and other light trucks.
